# Employee Management System (C)

## 📌 Overview
This is a **console-based Employee Management System** written in C.

The program simulates a simple system that allows the user to interact with employee-related operations through a menu-driven interface.

It is designed to demonstrate how a real-world console application can be structured using multiple source files.
